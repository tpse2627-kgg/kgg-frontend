# kgg-frontend

Frontend of the Knowledge Graph Generator (TPSE 2026/27, TU Darmstadt).

How we work (shared by all repos): [process](https://github.com/tpse2627-kgg/kgg-core/blob/develop/docs/process/process.md)

## Branching

We use [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (to be confirmed by the team):

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Released versions only (what the AG gets), each release tagged (`v0.1.0`, …) |
| `develop` | Integration branch; the default branch, all feature work is merged here |
| `feature/<issue>-<name>` | One per issue, branched from `develop`, merged back via pull request |
| `release/<version>` | Prepares a release from `develop`, merged into `main` and `develop` |
| `hotfix/<version>` | Urgent fix branched from `main`, merged into `main` and `develop` |

## Commit messages

We follow the [Karma commit convention](https://karma-runner.github.io/6.3/dev/git-commit-msg.html) / [semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) (to be confirmed by the team):
